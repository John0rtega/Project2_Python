# Project2_Python
Project 2 for my python course consists of 3 different small projects. ytDownload.py is a program to download youtube videos into you local files. pdf2voice.py is a program that reads a pdf file, like an audiobook. ScorePrediciton.py is a program that predicts a students final score based on previous exam scores.
